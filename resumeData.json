His biggest strength I would say is he is open to feedback & implements them asap to help himself grow. He also understands the requirement quickly and unblocks self through the various resources & tools when executing. Riken was able to onboard onto using some of our internal frameworks with ease & shared his learnings later with broader team. He actively participated in team social events & was easy to work with/help based on other team members feedback. I highly recommend Riken if you need to get the job done!",
